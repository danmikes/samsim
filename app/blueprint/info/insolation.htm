<h2>1. Insolation</h2>

<p>Insolation is composite of three orbital cycles: eccentricity, obliquity, precession. It affects global temperature. In turn global temperature affects absolute global sea-level.</p>

<p>Shoreline-trajectory is path of shoreline locations. It records sea-level relative to continent. Naively assuming continent static it represents global sea-level.</p>
